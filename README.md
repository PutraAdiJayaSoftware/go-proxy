# Cache Proxy with Fiber

This is a simple cache proxy implementation using the **Fiber** framework in Go. The proxy server stores responses from the source server in cache files. When the same URL is requested again, the server will return the cached data (if available) to speed up the response time.

## Features

- **File-based Caching**: Data requested is stored in cache files on the local file system.
- **Automatic Cache Clearing**: Cache is cleared every time the server is started, ensuring fresh cache data.
- **HTTP Proxy**: Acts as a proxy server to fetch data from the original source and cache it locally.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Go** installed on your system. You can download Go here: https://go.dev/dl/

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or create a new Go file.
   
2. Install **Fiber** by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go get github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2
   ```

## How to Run

1. **Clone or copy** the code to your local directory.
2. **Create a cache directory** (this will be used to store cache files):

   ```bash
   mkdir ./cache
   ```

3. **Run the server** with the following command:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

4. The server will run on `http://localhost:8080`. You can access it by providing the URL you want to proxy. For example:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080/http://example.com
   ```

5. The first request for a URL will fetch data from the source server and store it in the cache. Subsequent requests for the same URL will return the cached data (if available).

6. Every time the server is restarted, the cache will be cleared to ensure no outdated data is used.

## Browser Proxy Setup

To route your browser traffic through this proxy:

### 1. **Windows**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Network & Internet** > **Proxy**.
   - Turn on **Use a proxy server**, and enter **localhost** and **port 8080**.

### 2. **macOS**:
   - Go to **System Preferences** > **Network** > Select your active network > **Advanced** > **Proxies**.
   - Enable **Web Proxy (HTTP)** and enter **localhost** and **port 8080**.

### 3. **Firefox**:
   - Go to **Preferences** > **General** > **Network Settings**.
   - Select **Manual Proxy Configuration** and enter **localhost** and **port 8080**.

### 4. **Chrome/Edge**:
   - Use the system proxy settings to route traffic through **localhost** and **port 8080**.

Once the proxy is set up, your browser will route all HTTP requests to the proxy server, which will handle caching and return data from the cache if available.

```

## Features to Improve

- **Cache TTL**: Currently, the cache doesn't have a Time To Live (TTL). You can add TTL for each cached item to expire after a certain period.
- **HTTPS Support**: This proxy only supports HTTP. You can add support for HTTPS by using `http.ListenAndServeTLS`.
- **Middleware**: Add middleware for logging, authentication, etc., using Fiber's features.
